For my Milestone Project 3 in L5 Web Application Development, I have created a Flask-backed app designed with CRUD function in such a way that users can access a database to create, read, update and delete ethereal beings.  This app has been developed in such a way that it is very simple to use, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# User Experience - UX

## User Stories

As a User...

- I would like to be able to have a simple application that allows me to add a new being using the name and description.
- I would like to be able to edit the being's name as well as desription.
- I would like to be able to delete the being and for an alert to pop up incase the delete button is clicked accidentally.
- I would like to have an easy-to-use navigation system.

# Design

I chose these colours for specific earthy tones which represent the ethereal, fantasy world in which these beings dwell.

## Typography

I have used the following fonts: 
      
"Princess Sofia" as the font for the main header:

"Macondo" for the smaller headers and buttons:

"Updock" for the card titles:

I chose these fonts for their whimsical look to go in line with the app. I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for this.
