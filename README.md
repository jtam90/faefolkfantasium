# Faefolk Fantasium

You can visit the live site here.

For my Milestone Project 3 in L5 Web Application Development, I have created a Flask-backed app designed with CRUD function in such a way that users can access a database to create, read, update and delete ethereal beings.  This app has been developed in such a way that it is very simple to use, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

  ## User Experience - UX


  - User Stories

  As a User...

  - I would like to be able to have a simple application that allows me to add a new being using the name and description.
  - I would like to be able to edit the being's name as well as desription.
  - I would like to be able to delete the being and for an alert to pop up incase the delete button is clicked accidentally.
   - I would like to have an easy-to-use navigation system.

  ## Design

  - Colour Scheme

  Below represents the different colours used in this project:

  - #eaf276
  - #fff56d
  - #fffb00
  - #486b48 
  - #3e613e 
  - #263c26
  - #dc7601
      
  I chose these colours for specific earthy tones which represent the ethereal, fantasy world in which these beings dwell.

  ## Typography

  - I have used the following fonts: 
      
  "Princess Sofia" as the font for the main header:

  "Macondo" for the smaller headers and buttons:

  "Updock" for the card titles:

  I chose these fonts for their whimsical look to go in line with the app. I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for this.
